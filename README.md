Machine Learning in C: Housing Price Prediction
Overview
This repository hosts a C language-based machine learning application focused on predicting housing prices. The primary aim of this project is to explore and implement machine learning concepts using the C programming language, a field typically dominated by higher-level languages like Python and R. This project demonstrates the feasibility and methodology of performing data-driven predictions in a lower-level language environment.

Features
Data Processing: Implements functions for reading, normalizing, and splitting data.
Machine Learning Model: Uses linear regression with gradient descent for prediction.
Validation and Testing: Employs data validation and testing to evaluate model performance.

How to Run
Prerequisites
Docker

Steps
Clone the repository.
run "docker build -t gradient_descent_app ." into the gradient_descent folder
